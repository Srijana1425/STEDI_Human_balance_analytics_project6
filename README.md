# ðŸš€ STEDI-Human-Balance-Analytics
## Project Overview
This project involves processing and analyzing data from the STEDI Step Trainer, which includes Customer Records, Step Trainer Records, and Accelerometer Records. The goal is to create a data pipeline using AWS Glue, AWS S3, and Athena to transform and sanitize the data for further analysis.

## Project Data
STEDI has three JSON data sources

[customer](https://github.com/Srijana1425/STEDI_Human_balance_analytics_project6/tree/main/myproject-files/customer/landing)

[accelerometer](https://github.com/Srijana1425/STEDI_Human_balance_analytics_project6/tree/main/myproject-files/accelerometer/landing)

[step_trainer](https://github.com/Srijana1425/STEDI_Human_balance_analytics_project6/tree/main/myproject-files/step_trainer/landing)
